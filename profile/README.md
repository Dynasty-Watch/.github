# *Dynasty Watch*

The app enhances community safety by providing a mobile platform for users to request emergency assistance conveniently from their smartphones, replacing the need for traditional panic buttons at home. Users can submit detailed requests with text, images, and audio, while authorities can communicate with them en route to the requested location.
