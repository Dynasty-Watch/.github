# *Dynasty Watch*

The application helps the community in terms of safety by creating a mobile app for users to request for emergency assistance by using their mobile phone instead of using the traditional panic button at home. Mobile app users will also provide detailed information of their request using text, images, and audio. Authorities will be able to communicate with mobile app users as they are traveling to the requested location.
